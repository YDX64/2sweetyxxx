## üîß Current Configuration

### Dockerfile Settings
- **Build Stage**: Node.js 18-alpine with all dependencies
- **Production Stage**: nginx:1.25-alpine
- **Port**: 80 (configured for Coolify)
- **Health Check**: Configured at /

### Hardcoded Values (Currently in Use)
```javascript
// Firebase (in GoMeet Web/src/Users_Chats/Firebase.js)
apiKey: "AIzaSyDCZoLgY9bFxRcNFuV6IljwMVnnx0TL2to"
authDomain: "sweet-a6718.firebaseapp.com"
projectId: "sweet-a6718"
storageBucket: "sweet-a6718.firebasestorage.app"
messagingSenderId: "487435792097"
appId: "1:487435792097:web:12907427892d53c82251a0"

// API URLs (in GoMeet Web/src/Context/MyProvider.jsx)
basUrl: "https://gomeet.cscodetech.cloud/api/"
imageBaseURL: "https://gomeet.cscodetech.cloud/"
paymentBaseURL: "https://gomeet.cscodetech.cloud/"
```

**Note**: Your React app currently doesn't use environment variables. These values are hardcoded and will work as-is.

## üìã Deployment Checklist for Coolify

### Step 1: Application Settings in Coolify
- [x] Repository: `https://github.com/YDX64/2sweetyxxx`
- [x] Branch: `main`
- [x] Build Pack: **Dockerfile** (NOT Nixpack)
- [x] Dockerfile Path: `/Dockerfile` (root)

### Step 2: Port Configuration
- [x] Application Port: **80**
- [x] Exposed Port: **80**

### Step 3: Build Settings
- [x] Build Arguments: None required (all in Dockerfile)
- [x] Health Check: Already configured in Dockerfile

### Step 4: Environment Variables (OPTIONAL)
These won't affect the app currently but you can add for future:
```bash
GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false
CI=false
```

### Step 5: Deploy
1. Click **"Redeploy"** or **"Deploy"** in Coolify
2. Watch the build logs for:
   - ‚úÖ "npm ci" completes successfully
   - ‚úÖ "npm run build" completes successfully
   - ‚úÖ Docker image created successfully
   - ‚úÖ Container starts with nginx

---

## üéØ What Happens Next

1. **Build Phase** (~2-5 minutes):
   - Coolify pulls your code from GitHub
   - Runs npm ci (installs all dependencies)
   - Runs npm run build (creates production build)
   - Creates Docker image

2. **Deployment Phase** (~1 minute):
   - Starts nginx container
   - Serves your React app on port 80
   - Health check verifies it's running

3. **Access Your App**:
   - Coolify will provide a URL like: `https://your-app.coolify.domain`
   - Or use your custom domain if configured

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Firebase Configuration**: Your Firebase config is hardcoded and will work immediately
2. **API Connection**: The app will connect to `https://gomeet.cscodetech.cloud/api/`
3. **No Backend Needed**: This deployment is frontend-only
4. **SSL/HTTPS**: Coolify handles SSL certificates automatically

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### If you still see Bad Gateway:
1. Check Coolify build logs for errors
2. Verify port is set to 80 (not 3000)
3. Click "Restart" on the container

### If build fails:
1. Check if GitHub repository is still public
2. Verify Dockerfile exists at root
3. Check build logs for specific npm errors

### If app loads but doesn't work:
1. Check browser console for Firebase errors
2. Verify API at https://gomeet.cscodetech.cloud is accessible
3. Check Network tab for failed API calls

---

- ‚úÖ Build logs show "Successfully built"
- ‚úÖ Container status shows "Running"
