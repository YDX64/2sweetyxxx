# SwipeCard Photo Synchronization Fix - Summary

## Problem
The SwipeCard was showing only the first photo from a user's profile, while the actual profile page displayed all photos. This created an inconsistency where users would see different photos in different parts of the app.

## Root Cause
The `fetchProfiles` function in `profileService.ts` was intentionally limiting the photos array to only the first photo as a performance optimization or design decision.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated `profileService.ts` (Line 247-259)
Changed from:
```typescript
photos: profile.photos && profile.photos.length > 0 
  ? [profile.photos[0]] // Only show the first photo
```

To:
```typescript
photos: profile.photos && profile.photos.length > 0 
  ? profile.photos // Return ALL photos
```

### 2. Updated `SwipeCard.tsx` (Lines 64-81)
Restored multi-photo functionality:
- Changed from `mainPhoto` to `photos` array
- Re-added `nextPhoto` and `prevPhoto` functions for photo navigation
- Updated photo index management

### 3. Updated `SwipeCardContent.tsx`
Modified component to accept:
- `photos: string[]` instead of `mainPhoto: string`
- `currentPhotoIndex: number`
- `onNextPhoto` and `onPrevPhoto` callbacks

### 4. Updated PhotoGallery Integration
The PhotoGallery component now receives:
- Full photos array
- Current photo index
- Navigation callbacks

## Benefits
1. **Consistency**: Users now see all photos in both SwipeCard and profile views
2. **Better User Experience**: Users can browse through all photos before making a decision
3. **No Information Loss**: All uploaded photos are visible everywhere

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Upload multiple photos to a profile
- [ ] Verify all photos appear in SwipeCard
- [ ] Test photo navigation (next/previous) in SwipeCard
- [ ] Confirm photos match between SwipeCard and profile page
- [ ] Test with profiles that have only one photo
- [ ] Test with profiles that have no photos (default images)
- [ ] Verify performance is not impacted

## Potential Improvements
1. Add photo dots/indicators showing current photo position
2. Implement swipe gestures for photo navigation
3. Add photo preloading for smoother transitions
4. Consider lazy loading for profiles with many photos
