## Quick Test Command

Run this in your browser console after integration to verify all languages load:

```javascript
const languages = ['en', 'sv', 'no', 'fi', 'da', 'tr', 'ar', 'zh', 'fr', 'de', 'ru'];
languages.forEach(lang => {
  i18n.changeLanguage(lang);
  console.log(`${lang}: ${i18n.t('home')}`);
});
```

Expected output:
```
en: Home
sv: Hem
no: Hjem
fi: Koti
da: Hjem
tr: Ana Sayfa
ar: ÿßŸÑÿµŸÅÿ≠ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿ¶Ÿäÿ≥Ÿäÿ©
zh: È¶ñÈ°µ
fr: Accueil
de: Startseite
ru: –ì–ª–∞–≤–Ω–∞—è
